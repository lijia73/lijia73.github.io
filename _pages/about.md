Iâ€™m a first-year Ph.D. student from  [the Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html). 

My research interest includes fuzzing, software testing, and symbolic execution.

I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Michael R. Lyu.](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/lyu/home) of [ARISE Lab](http://ariselab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/).

You can find my CV here [Jia Li's Profile](../assets/profile.pdf).
